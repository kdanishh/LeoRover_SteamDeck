# Introduction
This project uses the [Steam Deck LCD](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) to control three modules on [Leo Rover](https://www.leorover.tech/). It primarily comprises:

|  Module|  Description|
|-----:|-----------|
|     1| Wheel Module|
|     2| Manipulator Module|

However, the integration is not yet complete. This documentation includes only the first two modules and is prepared for temporary reference.

# Installation

STEP 1: Install Ubuntu 20.04 on Steam-Deck-LCD

As of the preparation of this document, it appears that the Steam Deck OLED version does not directly support native installation of Ubuntu LTS. To avoid the hassle of installing Ubuntu on the Steam Deck, we have chosen the Steam Deck LCD version for this project. To quickly install Ubuntu without disrupting the SteamOS environment, we prefer using Distrobox to run Ubuntu 20.04 as a subsystem from the terminal within SteamOS.
